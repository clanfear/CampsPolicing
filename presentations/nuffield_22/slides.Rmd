# The Narrative

We are told homelessness, drug use, and property crime are out of control.

* .bam[A breakdown of law and order.]
* In Broken Windows terms, .bam[a spiral of decay].

--

[A prominent report](https://thecisforcrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/system-failure-prolific-offender-report-feb-2019.pdf) claimed Seattle's most "prolific offenders" are universally homeless, addicted, and allowed to run rampant.

--

The unhoused are presented as motivated offenders funding substance use via property crime.

* Their addiction justifies .bam[social control]: "they need to be helped"

--

.centernote[*But is the initial premise even valid?*]

Mobile app introduced by Seattle Customer Service Bureau (CSB) in 2013 for reporting issues like decaying infrastructure, dumping, and abandoned vehicles.

No option for homelessness--unlike San Francisco's 311 app.

Users have co-opted app to report homelessness under various categories---which has generated controversy.

CSB employees read and manually mark complaints for .bam[unauthorized camping].

# Complaints as Social Control

Research on social control typically focuses on...

* Sanctioning by the public (informal social control)
* Policing and the courts (formal social control)
* Social welfare regulation (formal social control)

--

Unauthorized camping complaints are an alternate appeal to formal social control.

* Potential substitute for ineffective police (or welfare) responses
* Perceived as less harmful than invoking police<sup>1</sup>
* Agents are empowered to compel movement and seize property: .bam[encampment sweeps]

.footnote[[1] Complaints end up in the same Navigation Team pool as police calls.]

???

We actually have text of comlaints---people are often angry, demanding *something* be done.

# Sweeps

Sweeps are the ultimate formal social control response to "unauthorized camping"

--

Joint city and police encampment removals:

* 72-hour warning unless hazard or obstruction
* Offer social services (~15% uptake)
   * Often nightly shelter without secure storage
* Discard "waste" and store "belongings"
* Highly discretionary, unobserved selection process

--

Negative impacts on unhoused population

* Deprivation of property
   * Barriers to reacquisition
* Forced relocation

---
# Our Questions

* Is the narrative correct, that visible homelessness is driving property crime?

--

* Are complaints about homelessness actually about visible homelessness... or about crime?

* Do complaints translate into sweeps of encampments?

# Measuring Homelessness

Visible signs of homelessness is commonly treated as form of "disorder" in Broken Windows research.


This research often uses complaints to the city as *measure* of disorder prevalence.<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] e.g., [O'Brien & Sampson (2015)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022427815577835)]

--

Social control capacity influences reporting, particularly for minor violations.

This induces spuriousness between complaint-based measures of homelessness and crime.

--

We need a measure of where the unhoused live which is independent of reporting propensity.

# The Tent Census

.pull-left[
In April through August of 2019, Karen Snedker's team at Seattle Pacific University conducted a census of encampments for her tent cities project.

In Autumn 2019 and Summer 2020, they resampled high density areas to observe change over time.

This provides three measures of .bam[visible homelessness] independent of reporting actions.

# Question 1:

### Does visible homelessness lead to property crime?

---
# Challenges

* Many potential confounders

   * Most relatively time-stable
      * e.g., social control, built environment

--

* Reciprocality if property crime leads to displacement

--

* Only 3 waves of tent census (small T), with inconsistent spans and spacing

   * Summer 2019
   * Late Autumn 2019
   * Spring-Summer 2020

--

* Ambiguous geographical units

   * Tents and crime are point data
   * Only certain areas resampled, not based on administrative boundary
     * e.g., the Interstate 5 highway corridor


---
# Approach

1. Aggregate to US census blockgroups

  * Minimizes inclusion of unsampled area
  * Sufficient counts of property crime
  * Incorporates physical boundaries

--

2. .bam[Maximum likelihood fixed-effects cross-lagged panel estimator]<sup>1</sup>

* Asymptotically equivalent to Arellano-Bond GMM
   * Addresses time-stable confounders
   * Avoids Nickell bias
* Advantages:
   * More efficient
   * Less biased with small N or strong autoregression
   * Coefficients and error variances can vary between waves

Very similar results with rates or logging outcome; log tends to fit a bit better but there are zeroes. DPM complicated to set up with Poisson link.

# Crime, Complaints, and Sweeps

Have a few waves for sweeps... but count or endogenous binary

Can I do a logit outcome on sweeps?

Interact complaints with median income or something?

# Summary

* Visible homelessness isn't associated with property crime

* Complaints are associated with both visible homelessness and property crime

* Sweeps are associated with complaints and visible homelessness

Maybe put diagram here, X out the tents -> prop crime line

---
# Implications

* Visible unhoused population 

---
# Recent Developments

* In 2021, the Navigation Team was replaced by Homelessness Outreach and Provider Ecosystem (HOPE) Team

   * No embedded police
   * Does not participate in sweeps / removals
   * Conducts outreach prior to city removals

* Sweeps paused during initial COVID-19 wave

   * Resumed in Spring 2021
