# The Narrative

We are told homelessness, drug use, and property crime are out of control.
* In Broken Windows terms, .bam[a spiral of decay].

--

[A prominent report](https://thecisforcrank.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/system-failure-prolific-offender-report-feb-2019.pdf) claims Seattle's most "prolific offenders" are universally homeless, addicted, and allowed to run rampant.
* .bam[A breakdown of law and order.]

--

The homeless fund substance use with property crime.

* The unhoused as motivated offenders
* Addiction justifies .bam[social control]: "they need to be helped"

--

Cause is tied hands of police, defacto drug decriminalization, and absence of compulsory treatment.

--

# Complaints as Social Control

Research on social control typically focuses on...

* Sanctioning by the public (informal social control)
* Policing and the courts (formal social control)
* Social welfare regulation (formal social control)

--

Unauthorized camping complaints are an alternate appeal to formal social control.

* Potential substitute for ineffective police (or welfare) responses
* Perceived as less harmful than invoking police<sup>1</sup>
* Agents are empowered to compel movement and seize property: .bam[encampment sweeps]

.footnote[[1] Complaints end up in the same Navigation Team pool as police calls.]

# Sweeps

Sweeps are the ultimate formal social control response to "unauthorized camping"

--

Joint city and police encampment removals:

* Offer social services (~15% uptake)
   * Often nightly shelter without secure storage
* Discard "waste" and store "belongings"
* Highly discretionary, unobserved selection process

--

Negative impacts on unhoused population

* Deprivation of property
   * Barriers to reacquisition
* Forced relocation
* Fear and anxiety over future sweeps
* Alienation from city services and agents

---
# Our Questions

* Is the narrative correct, that visible homelessness is driving property crime?

--

* Are complaints about homelessness actually about visible homelessness... or about crime?

--

* Do complaints translate into sweeps of encampments?

## Complaints: Find It, Fix It

.pull-left[
Mobile app introduced by Seattle Customer Service Bureau (CSB) in 2013 for reporting issues like decaying infrastructure, dumping, and abandoned vehicles.

No option for homelessness--unlike San Francisco's 311 app.

Users have co-opted app to report homelessness under various categories.

CSB employees read and manually mark complaints for .bam[unauthorized camping].

# Measuring Homelessness

Visible homelessness is commonly considered a form of disorder, such as in the Broken Windows thesis.


Research on disorder and crime frequently uses complaints to the city as a *measure* of prevalence of disorder.<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] e.g., [O'Brien & Sampson (2015)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022427815577835) ]

--

Social control capacity influences reporting, particularly for minor violations.

This induces spuriousness between complaint-based measures of homelessness and crime.

--

We need a measure of homelessness independent of reporting propensity.

---
# The Tent Census

.pull-left[
In April through August of 2019, Karen Snedker's team at Seattle Pacific University conducted a census of encampments for her tent cities project.

In Autumn 2019 and Summer 2020, they resampled high density areas to observe change over time.

This provides three measures of .bam[visible homelessness] independent of reporting.

# Question 1:

### Does visible homelessness lead to property crime?


---
# Methods

&zwj;Challenges:

* Many potential confounders
   * Most relatively time-stable (e.g., social control, built environment)
* Only 3 waves of tent census (small T)
* Inconsistent time spans and wave spacing
* Only certain areas resampled (small N: 41 blockgroups)

--

&zwj;Approach: .bam[Maximum likelihood fixed-effects cross-lagged panel estimator]<sup>1</sup>

* Asymptotically equivalent to Arellano-Bond GMM
   * Addresses time-stable confounders, avoids Nickell bias
   * More efficient
   * Less biased with small N or strong autoregression
* Allows lagged effects and error variance to vary between waves

Very similar results with rates or logging outcome; log tends to fit a bit better but there are zeroes. DPM complicated to set up with Poisson link.

Teal correlation between epsilon 2 and Tents 3 makes tents 3 predetermined or sequentially exogenous rather than strictly exogenous.

# Methods

&zwj;Challenges:

* Only one period has both complaints and tent census
* Many potential confounders

--

&zwj;Approaches:

* Crude cross-sectional analysis with homelessness
* Many time-period DPM with only complaints and crime

Long series here allows for DPM again; can run both sides of model

# Crime, Complaints, and Sweeps

Have a few waves for sweeps... but count or endogenous binary

Can I do a logit outcome on sweeps?

Interact complaints with median income or something?

# Future Directions

* Where are tents located?
   * Physical characteristics (roads, bridges, parks)
   * Social characteristics (stability, social control)
   
   A [report by the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/23/homeless-villages-crime-rate-seattle-portland) and an unpublished study by Dartmouth applied economics students both found negative associations between crime and tent cities and tiny house villages in Seattle.
