The narrative

The descriptive reality
  Crime flat
  Homelessness up
  Complaints way up

Question 1: Does homelessness predict crime
  Problem: Complaints are not a good measure of homelessness, and common counts aren't granular or frequent.
  Solution: Independent data on homelessness.

Question 2: What predicts complaints? Is it driven by crime or visible homelessness?

Question 3: What are the consequences of complaints?
